IMAP and SMTP via MCP Server

- **Github repository**: <https://github.com/ai-zerolab/mcp-email-server/>
- **Documentation** <https://ai-zerolab.github.io/mcp-email-server/>

## Installation

### Manual Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage your environment.

Try `uvx mcp-email-server@latest ui` to config, and use following configuration for mcp client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

This package is available on PyPI, so you can install it using `pip install mcp-email-server`

After that, configure your email server using the ui: `mcp-email-server ui`

### Environment Variable Configuration

You can also configure the email server using environment variables, which is particularly useful for CI/CD environments like Jenkins. zerolib-email supports both UI configuration (via TOML file) and environment variables, with environment variables taking precedence.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_ACCOUNT_NAME": "work",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_FULL_NAME": "John Doe",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS": "john@example.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_USER_NAME": "john@example.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_HOST": "imap.gmail.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_PORT": "993",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_HOST": "smtp.gmail.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_PORT": "465"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Read-only IMAP mode

SMTP configuration is optional. When `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_HOST` is omitted, the account runs in read-only mode and exposes only read/mailbox-management tools. Outbound compose tools such as `send_email` and `save_to_mailbox` are hidden when every configured email account is read-only.

Note that omitting SMTP only disables outbound compose tools. Mailbox-mutating tools that work over IMAP (`delete_emails`, `move_emails`, `archive_emails`, `mark_emails_as_read`) remain available. For a strict guarantee, use enforced read-only mode below.

### Enforced read-only mode

Set `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_READ_ONLY=true` (or `read_only = true` in `config.toml`) to make the whole server strictly read-only:

- Every mutating tool (`send_email`, `save_to_mailbox`, `delete_emails`, `move_emails`, `archive_emails`, `mark_emails_as_read`, `add_email_account`, and `get_emails_content` with `mark_as_read=true`) is hidden from tool listings **and** rejects direct calls with a `PermissionError` — hiding alone would not stop a client that calls a tool without listing it first.
- Read paths open mailboxes with IMAP `EXAMINE` instead of `SELECT`, so the server session cannot change message flags even implicitly.

### Health check

HTTP transports expose `GET /healthz`, which attempts an IMAP login for every configured account and reports per-account status:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "read_only": true, "accounts": { "gmail-rav": "ok" }, "cached": false }
```

Returns `200` when every login succeeds, `503` otherwise. Results are cached (5 minutes for success, 1 minute for failure) so frequent polling does not hammer the IMAP servers with logins.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS": "john@example.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_HOST": "imap.gmail.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Transport Security

HTTP transports (`sse` and `streamable-http`) validate request `Host` and `Origin` headers to protect against DNS rebinding attacks. Localhost is allowed by default. For Docker networks or reverse proxies, configure the expected service names explicitly.

| Variable                              | Description                                                      | Default           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `MCP_HOST`                            | HTTP bind host for `streamable-http`                             | `localhost`       |
| `MCP_PORT`                            | HTTP bind port for `streamable-http`                             | `9557`            |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`                   | Comma-separated allowed `Host` values. Supports `host:*` ports   | Localhost hosts   |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`                 | Comma-separated allowed `Origin` values. Supports `host:*` ports | Localhost origins |
| `MCP_ENABLE_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION` | Enable DNS rebinding protection                                  | `true`            |

Docker Compose example:

```yaml
services:
  mcp-email-server:
    image: ghcr.io/ai-zerolab/mcp-email-server:latest
    command: ["streamable-http"]
    environment:
      MCP_HOST: 0.0.0.0
      MCP_PORT: 9557
      MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS: mcp-email-server:*,localhost:*,127.0.0.1:*
      MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: http://mcp-email-server:*,http://localhost:*,http://127.0.0.1:*
```

Bare host entries such as `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS=mcp-email-server` also allow any port on that host. `MCP_ENABLE_DNS_REBINDING_PROTECTION=false`, `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*`, or `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` disables Host and Origin validation entirely. Use those options only in isolated local development environments.

IPv6 literals in allowlists should use bracketed notation, such as `[::1]:*` and `http://[::1]:*`.

### Enabling Attachment Downloads

By default, downloading email attachments is disabled for security reasons. To enable this feature, you can either:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_ENABLE_ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOAD": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: TOML Configuration**

Add `enable_attachment_download = true` to your TOML configuration file (`~/.config/zerolib/mcp_email_server/config.toml`):

```toml
enable_attachment_download = true

[[emails]]
# ... your email configuration
```

Once enabled, you can use the `download_attachment` tool to save email attachments to a specified path.

### Saving Sent Emails to IMAP Sent Folder

By default, sent emails are automatically saved to your IMAP Sent folder. This ensures that emails sent via the MCP server appear in your email client (Thunderbird, webmail, etc.).

The server auto-detects common Sent folder names: `Sent`, `INBOX.Sent`, `Sent Items`, `Sent Mail`, `[Gmail]/Sent Mail`.

**To specify a custom Sent folder name** (useful for providers with non-standard folder names):

**Option 1: Environment Variable**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SENT_FOLDER_NAME": "INBOX.Sent"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: TOML Configuration**

```toml
[[emails]]
account_name = "work"
save_to_sent = true
sent_folder_name = "INBOX.Sent"
# ... rest of your email configuration
```

**To disable saving to Sent folder**, set `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SAVE_TO_SENT=false` or `save_to_sent = false` in your TOML config.

### Restricting Recipients (Allowlist)

By default the server can send to any address. Set `allowed_recipients` to restrict **both**
`send_email` and `save_to_mailbox` to a trusted set. Leave it empty (the default) to allow all.

```toml
allowed_recipients = ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
```

Or via environment variable (comma-separated):

```
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS="alice@example.com,bob@example.com"
```

When configured, any To/CC/BCC address not on the list is rejected with a clear error. Matching is
case-insensitive and understands the `Name <addr@example.com>` form. The `list_allowed_recipients`
tool appears only when an allowlist is configured, so default installs keep a minimal tool surface.

### Filtering Incoming Mail (Sender Allowlist)

By default all senders are visible. Set `allowed_senders` to show mail only from trusted senders.
Patterns support globs (e.g. `*@company.com`) and exact addresses, matched case-insensitively. Leave
it empty (the default) to show everything.

```toml
allowed_senders = ["*@company.com", "alice@example.com"]
```

Or via environment variable (comma-separated):

```
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_ALLOWED_SENDERS="*@company.com,alice@example.com"
```

When configured, filtering is applied in the read path: `list_emails_metadata` excludes non-allowed
senders **before** pagination, so `total` and page sizes reflect only allowed mail; `get_emails_content`
and `download_attachment` check the sender before reading a message, so a non-allowed message's body and
attachments are never fetched or marked read, and it is reported as inaccessible — indistinguishable from
a missing message. The `list_allowed_senders` tool appears only when an allowlist is configured.

**Scope:** the allowlist protects read paths only (`list_emails_metadata`, `get_emails_content`,
`download_attachment`). UID-based mutation tools (`delete_emails`, `mark_emails_as_read`, `move_emails`,
`archive_emails`) are not yet filtered and can still act on any UID; enforcing the allowlist on those is
planned as a follow-up.

**Note:** matching is against the message's `From` header — local filtering only, not sender
authentication. A spoofed `From` will pass the allowlist, so this is not a substitute for provider-side
SPF / DKIM / DMARC enforcement.

### Self-Signed Certificates and IMAP STARTTLS (e.g., ProtonMail Bridge)

Local mail bridges such as ProtonMail Bridge commonly use STARTTLS with self-signed certificates. Configure IMAP with plaintext connect plus STARTTLS upgrade, and disable certificate verification for the local bridge certificate:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_SSL": "false",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_START_SSL": "true",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_VERIFY_SSL": "false",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_VERIFY_SSL": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or in TOML configuration:

```toml
[[emails]]
account_name = "protonmail"
# ... other settings ...

[emails.incoming]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 1143
use_ssl = false
start_ssl = true
verify_ssl = false

[emails.outgoing]
verify_ssl = false
```

For separate IMAP/SMTP credentials, you can also use:

- `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_USER_NAME` / `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_PASSWORD`
- `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_USER_NAME` / `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_PASSWORD`

Then you can try it in [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download). If you want to intergrate it with other mcp client, run `$which mcp-email-server` for the path and configure it in your client like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "{{ ENTRYPOINT }}",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

If `docker` is avaliable, you can try use docker image, but you may need to config it in your client using `tools` via `MCP`. The default config path is `~/.config/zerolib/mcp_email_server/config.toml`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zerolib-email": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-it", "ghcr.io/ai-zerolab/mcp-email-server:latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing via Smithery

To install Email Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@ai-zerolab/mcp-email-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @ai-zerolab/mcp-email-server --client claude
```

## Usage

### Replying to Emails

To reply to an email with proper threading (so it appears in the same conversation in email clients):

1. First, fetch the original email to get its `message_id`:

```python
emails = await get_emails_content(account_name="work", email_ids=["123"])
original = emails.emails[0]
```

2. Send your reply using `in_reply_to` and `references`:

```python
await send_email(
    account_name="work",
    recipients=[original.sender],
    subject=f"Re: {original.subject}",
    body="Thank you for your email...",
    in_reply_to=original.message_id,
    references=original.message_id,
)
```

The `in_reply_to` parameter sets the `In-Reply-To` header, and `references` sets the `References` header. Both are used by email clients to thread conversations properly.
